The following code includes snippets from code created throughout the bootcamp, as well as the main base from the original excercise, given an original mistake wehre the final result expectations was leaked, therefore creating a confusion in the original instructions. It was later informed that an exception for this excercise was admitted and the final code could be used as a base for the design. 

## NOTES
The design and interactivity of the page at this stage of the excercise is very basic, and is expected to be updated in the following days, but the MVP was set to be delivered to obtain a passing grade for this challenge. More work should've been dedicated to the challenge but due to the work shcedule on my end it was very difficult to dedicate enough time to do the project exceptionally. This however will not hamper the final result, that will be perfected in the following days, now that I have a little more time in my hands, for the moment.
